  <h1>Some types of Computer Languages</h1>
<div class="div1" id="div1">
    <h2>C Language</h2>
<ul>
  <li>C language was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Laboratories. In 1989, the C language was standardized, where 
      C language features were defined, also known as the 1989 ANSI standard for C, and that is the reason, you will see C language 
      also called C89, because of the 1989 ANSI standard.</li>
  <li>The current latest version of the C language is C99, as some new features were added to the C language in 1999.</li>
  <li>You must be thinking, 1999 was more than 20 years ago, but the C language is still very relevant and widely used although there 
      are many other new languages like C++, Java, Python, C#, etc. in the market.</li>
  <li>C Language is a middle-level, structured programming language, that needs a compiler for running the programs written in 
      C language.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="div1" id="div2">
  <h2>Java</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies 
      as possible.</li> 
  <li>It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),meaning that compiled Java 
      code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.</li>
  <li>Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying 
      computer architecture.</li>
  <li>The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides 
      dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled 
      languages. </li>
  <li>As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,articularly for client 
      server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="div1" id="div3">
  <h2>Python</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with 
    the use of significant indentation.</li>
  <li>Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly 
      procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its 
      comprehensive standard library.</li>
  <li>Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 
      as Python 0.9.0.</li>
  <li>Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage 
      collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely 
      backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.</li>
  <li>Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.</li>
</ul>
